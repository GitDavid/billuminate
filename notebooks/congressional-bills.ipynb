      "text The benefits of the powerful economy of the United States have gone almost entirely to the richest people in society, which has created a growing gap between the wealthy and the rest of our country.\n",
      "text Such widening disparities are unhealthy for our democracy and unhealthy for the broad swath of working families who are unable to afford to pay their rent or buy a home, save for their children’s higher education, or afford the basic necessities to live a dignified and full life.\n",

      "text This contrasts with the 1949–1979 era, when the economy of the United States was functioning below full employment only 31 percent of the time.\n",

      "text Since 1979, although economy-wide productivity has grown by 64.3 percent, women’s median wages have risen by only 20.6 percent and men’s median wages have actually fallen by 8.9 percent, and the statistics for Black and Hispanic workers are even worse than for White workers.\n",
      "text Workers’ share of corporate income has shrunk significantly, from 82.3 percent during the full employment economy of 2000 to 75.5 percent today, a decline that means that workers will earn $535 billion less this year than they would have had the share remained stable, or approximately $3,770 per worker this year.\n",
      "text Between 2002 and 2014, inflation-adjusted hourly wages for the bottom seven deciles (that is, 70 percent of the workforce of the United States) fell, showing that wage stagnation is not limited to low-income families.\n",

      "text Although there is no empirical evidence that an inflation rate of 3 or 4 percent would be harmful, or would be difficult to maintain at a stable rate, many observers believe that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System actually treats its 2-percent inflation target as a ceiling.\n",
      "text Over recent decades and even today, refusal by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to tolerate any inflation means that it has consistently raised interest rates prematurely during recoveries, preventing the economy from reaching full employment.\n",
